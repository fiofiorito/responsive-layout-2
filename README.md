# responsive-layout-2

## Overview
This is a website I made using HTML and CSS only (it does not have functionality, it just looks pretty)
I haven't added media queries quite yet, so when shrinking it too much, it becomes a mess but for the most part it looks nice!
The idea behind this webpage is to keep the natural responsiveness while giving it a more complex layout and styling :)
